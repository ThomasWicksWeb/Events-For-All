# Events-For-All

## What is Events-For-All?
Events-For-All is a social media website for people looking to get out and find others with the same interests.

This is done fully by the community of Events-For-All, where registered users are able to create and host events of their own, or alternatively attend events created by others.

No matter what one's interest might be, whether it range from sports and adventuring outdoors, to taste-testing wine with others, there's a community waiting for you already - and if there isn't, you can make it yourself!
